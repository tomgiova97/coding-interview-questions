# AI-Powered Full-Stack Interview Prep

This repository contains an automated system designed to generate high-quality, technically accurate answers to common Full-Stack Developer interview questions. The system leverages the Gemini API to provide detailed responses formatted in LaTeX, ensuring mathematical and technical notation is rendered perfectly.

## 🚀 How It Works

The core of the project is an automated pipeline that processes a curated list of interview questions:

1. Storage: All questions are stored in a coding-questions.json file.
2. Automation: A Flask-based background job runs every 30 minutes (configurable).
3. Processing: The job scans the JSON file for an object where the answer field is empty.
4. AI Integration: It sends the question to the Gemini AI model with a specific prompt to generate the answer in LaTeX format.
5. Persistence: The generated answer is saved back into the coding-questions.json file, updating the existing object.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Backend: Python / Flask
* AI Model: Google Gemini (via Generative AI SDK)
* Data Format: JSON (for storage), LaTeX (for technical answers)
* Task Scheduling: Flask-executor or APScheduler

## 📂 Data Structure

The coding-questions.json file follows this schema:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "Explain the difference between Prototypal and Classical inheritance.",
    "answer": "...(LaTeX content generated by AI)...",
    "category": "JavaScript"
  }
]

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- A Google Cloud API Key for Gemini

### 1. Clone the repository


### 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API key:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

### 4. Run the Application
python app.py

## 📄 Generating the Final LaTeX File

Once your questions have been answered by the AI, you can generate a single, formatted `.txt` document containing all the content.

1. Inside `.file_utils.py`, run the generation function:
   `json_to_latex()`, by providing the path for the output file

This script iterates through coding-questions.json, wraps the content in a LaTeX document class (e.g., article), and exports everything to a file.

## 🎓 Usage and PDF Compilation

To view your final interview guide, you need to compile the generated file:

### Option A: Local Compilation
If you have a LaTeX distribution installed, you can copy-paste the file content and generate the pdf file.

### Option B: Online (Overleaf)
If you have a paid version, you can copy-paste the file content here and generate the pdf file.
The free-version is usually not suitable for compiling long files as this one.  

## 📝 Configuration

You can adjust the frequency of the generation job directly in the app.py file. By default, it is set to run every 30 minutes to respect API rate limits and allow for gradual database building.
